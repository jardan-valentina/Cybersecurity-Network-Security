<h1>Network Security</h1>
<h2>Part 1: Review Questions</h2>
Before moving on to the lab exercises, complete the following review questions:

<h3>Security Control Types</h3>
The concept of defense-in-depth can be broken down into three security control types. Identify the security control type of each set of defense tactics.
<ul>
<li>Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?</li>
<li>Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?</li>
<li>Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intrusion Detection and Attack Indicators</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?</li>
    <li>What's the difference between an indicator of attack (IOA) and an indicator of compromise (IOC)?</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Cyber Kill Chain</h3>
Name the seven stages of the cyber kill chain, and provide a brief example of each.
<ul>
    <li>Stage 1:</li>
    <li>Stage 2:</li>
    <li>Stage 3:</li>
    <li>Stage 4:</li>
    <li>Stage 5:</li>
    <li>Stage 6:</li>
    <li>Stage 7:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Snort Rule Analysis</h3>
Use the provided Snort rules to answer the following questions:
<b>Snort Rule #1</b>
                  alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
<ul>
   <li>Break down the Snort rule header and explain what this rule does.</li>
   <li>What stage of the cyber kill chain does the alerted activity violate?</li>
   <li>What kind of attack is indicated?</li>
</ul>

<b>Snort Rule #2</b>

alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP"; flow:established,to_client; flowbits:isnotset,ET.http.binary; flowbits:isnotset,ET.INFO.WindowsUpdate; file_data; content:"MZ"; within:2; byte_jump:4,58,relative,little; content:"PE|00 00|"; distance:-64; within:4; flowbits:set,ET.http.binary; metadata: former_category POLICY; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018959; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2018959; rev:4; metadata:created_at 2014_08_19, updated_at 2017_02_01;)
<ul>
    <li>Break down the Snort rule header and explain what this rule does.</li>
    <li>What layer of the cyber kill chain does the alerted activity violate?</li>
    <li>What kind of attack is indicated?</li>
</ul>

<b>Snort Rule #3</b>
Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port <b>4444</b> to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the <b>msg</b> in the rule option.
<h2>Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab</h2>
In this lab exercise, you will assume the role of a junior security administrator at an indoor skydiving company called Drop Zone.
<ul>
    <li>Your company hosts a web server that accepts online reservations and credit card payments. As a result, your company must comply with PCI/DSS regulations that require businesses who accept online credit card payments to have a firewall in place to protect personally identifiable information (PII).</li>
    <li>Your network has been under attack from the following three IPs: <b>10.208.56.23</b>, <b>135.95.103.76</b>, and <b>76.34.169.118</b>. You have decided to add these IPs to the <b>drop</b> zone within your firewall.</li>
    <li>The first requirement of PCI/DSS regulations is to protect your system with firewalls. "Properly configured firewalls protect your card data environment. Firewalls restrict incoming and outgoing network traffic through rules and criteria configured by your organization." â€”  <a href="https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/library.php?category=pcidss&subcategory=pcidss_supporting%23results" target="_blank"> PCI DSS Quick Reference Guide </a> </li>
